                        <note>John Kay (1742–1826), portrait etcher and miniature painter, worked as
                            barber in Edinburgh for seven years, thereby earning the nickname used
                            for him throughout this correspondence. In December 1777 he purchased
                            the freedom of the city and was able to start a business of his own,
                            whilst an annuity granted in 1785 allowed him to give up his work as a
                            barber and concentrate on creating caricature portraits, which he sold
                            from his shop. Plans for publishing his work, which amounted to almost
                            900 plates, were incomplete at the time of his death. His work favoured
                            liberals but was broad in its scope and its witty portrayal of Edinburgh
                            society. ODNB. </note>

                            Pennant from 1769 and continued to receive patronage from the Pennant
                            family even after the death of Thomas Pennant. He accompanied Pennant on
                            his 1769 and 1772 Scottish tours, his illustrations published in A tour
                            in Scotland and voyage to the Hebrides in 1774, and was also the
                            illustrator for his Welsh tours. Moses Griffith married Margaret Jones
                            on 9 January 1781, and they had two children, Moses and Margaret.

                            Gloddaeth, Caernarvonshire. He married Margaret, daughter of Rev. Hugh
                            Wynn, Bodysgallen and Berthddu, and his wife, Catherine. He was a
                            vice-president of the Welsh Charity School in London, and his Welsh
                            cultural interests are signalled by the dedication of Evan Evans's Some
                            Specimens of the Poetry of the Antient Welsh Bards (1764) to him. In
                            December 1792 he became a member of the Loyalist Flintshire Association
                            promoted by his brother-in-law, Thomas Pennant. Mostyn's relationship
                            with Pennant is evinced in the latter's correspondence from Pennant's
                            frequent use of franks in his name. DWB; History of Parliament on-line.

                            Pennant. He published eight of Pennant’s books. White's son Benjamin was
                            involved in the business from 1785, and the firm was renamed Benjamin

                            another son, John, had also become involved in the company. ODNB.

                        <note>ODNB entry:(1746/7–1820), antiquary, was born Adam Cardonnel; he was a
                            great-nephew of Adam de Cardonnel, secretary to the duke of Marlborough,
                            and the sole surviving son of Mansfeldt de Cardonnel (1696/7–1780), of
                            Musselburgh, a commissioner of the customs and salt duties in Scotland,
                            and his wife, Anne, the daughter and heir of Thomas Hilton of Low Ford,
                            co. Durham. After being educated for the medical profession he practised
                            for a while in Edinburgh as a surgeon, but his easy circumstances left
                            him leisure to indulge his interest in the study of antiquities and
                            numismatics. Upon the institution of the Society of Antiquaries of
                            Scotland, under the presidency of the earl of Bute, in December 1780,
                            Cardonnel was elected a fellow; he also served as curator from 1782 to
                            1784, and contributed to the second volume of the Archaeologia Scotica
                            (1.159–67), ‘A description of certain Roman ruins discovered at
                            Inveresk’. He also produced Numismata Scotiae, or, A Series of Scottish
                            Coinage (1786), which he illustrated himself. Although it was largely
                            derived from Thomas Snelling's View of the Silver Coin and Coinage of
                            Scotland (1774), it contained some interesting historical material and
                            was regarded as generally accurate. Cardonnel also published, in four
                            parts, Picturesque Antiquities of Scotland (1788–93), etched by himself;
                            a second edition in one volume was published in 1802. When Francis Grose
                            visited Scotland, Cardonnel, who then resided at Edinburgh, assisted his
                            brother antiquary with notes from his extensive collections, besides
                            accompanying him on various archaeological expeditions, attentions that
                            Grose acknowledged in the introduction to his Antiquities of Scotland.
                            In the autumn of 1789 Burns addressed a letter to Grose, under cover to
                            Cardonnel at Edinburgh. While in the act of folding it up the quaint old
                            song of ‘Sir John Malcolm’ ran through his mind, and he inscribed within
                            the wrapper his well-known impromptu ‘Ken ye ought o' Captain Grose?’

                            and author of Antiquities and Scenery in the North of Scotland, in a
                            Series of Letters to Thomas Pennant (1780) and Remarkable ruins and
                            romantic prospects of north Britain, with ancient monuments and singular
                            subjects of natural history (2 vols., 1788–95), which originally
                            appeared in numbers and for which he provided images, engraved by James
                            Basire and others. Pennant considered the Antiquities and Scenery to be
                            an extension of his own 1769 and 1772 Scottish tours. ODNB; Murdo

                        <note>Joseph Edmondson (bap. 1732, d. 1786), herald and coach-painter, who
                            made his name among the nobility following the publication from 1764 of
                            an updated version of the Baronagium genealogicum, a manuscript
                            collection of the pedigrees of peers, initially in numbers. Further
                            works included the notable two-volume A Complete Body of Heraldry
                            (1780). Edmondson died on 17 February 1786. His library, of which the
                            British Library holds a printed catalogue, was sold in 1788. The son
                            named by Bull in TP189/6 was probably his elder son, Philip (b. 1756?),
                            who continued his father's prosperous coach-painting business.

                            intended to illustrate the ‘history of the Families, Manners, Habits and
                            Arts from the Norman conquest’, and valued chiefly for its
                            illustrations, engraved by James Basire. Director of the Society of
                            Antiquaries (1771–97), fellow of the Royal Society (1775–95) and regular
                            correspondent with the Gentleman's Magazine, Gough was enabled to commit
                            himself unreservedly to his own antiquarian researches and to helping
                            other antiquaries from a position of independent fortune, conferred upon
                            him on the deaths of his parents in 1751 and 1774. ODNB. </note>

                        <note>Francis Grose (bap. 1731, d. 1791), an antiquary who popularized the
                            field of antiquarianism. Known as 'Captain Grose' following his
                            promotion to captain in the Surrey regiment of the militia in 1765,
                            Grose had shown an early interest in sketching. In 1772 he published the
                            first number of The Antiquities of England and Wales, a work in an
                            innovative format offering a series of engravings alongside descriptive
                            text, the latter sometimes taken (with acknowledgement) from published
                            books or from fellow antiquaries, at other times from material collected
                            through correspondence. Tours in 1788, 1789 and 1790 lead to the
                            publication of The Antiquities of Scotland, but Grose died in Dublin
                            before he had much made progress on a companion study, The Antiquities
                            of Ireland. ODNB.</note>

                        <note>Henry Hughs (or Hughes) was a Fleet Street (see Evans, 274) printer
                            involved in the printing of Pennant's two-volume A tour in Wales in
                            1778, 1781 and 1783, together with Supplemental plates to the tours in
                            Wales in 1781 and an edition subtitled Supplemental corrections and
                            additions to the first volume of the Welsh Tour in 1784. He was the
                            printer of Arctic zoology (2 vols.; 1784, 1785); The view of Hindoostan
                            (1798); and a second edition of Indian zoology ('for R. Faulder', 1790).
                            He may be the 'Hughes' named alongside 'West', from no. 40, Paternoster
                            Row, as sellers of Pennant's posthumously-published A tour from Downing
                            to Alston-Moor and A journey from London to the Isle of Wight (both in
                            1801). Pennant’s references to his base in Turnstile, Holborn, suggests
                            a relation with John Hughs (d.?1771 /1774), printer to House of Commons,
                            of the same address. In 1796 he gave his address as King's Road, Bedford

                        <note>Peter Mazell was the son of French Huguenots parents living in Dublin,
                            and worked as a painter and engraver from various London addresses,
                            including at Portland Street (1783) and Covent Garden (1791), during
                            c.1761–1797. An exhibitor of paintings of landscapes and flowers, his
                            engravings of natural history subjects was a notable part of the
                            productions of authors including John Walcott and Thomas Pennant. His
                            natural history illustrations for the latter involved the use of
                            paintings of birds by Peter Paillou in British Zoology, History of
                            Quadrupeds, Arctic Zoology and Tour of Wales, 1778, and he was also the
                            engraver and publisher of the work of Pennant's protégé Charles
                            Cordiner, Remarkable ruins and romantic prospects of north Britain, with
                            ancient monuments and singular subjects of natural history (London: P.
                            Mazell, 1788–[95]). </note>

                            LETTERS: Samuel Salter (bap. 1713, d. 1778), Church of England
                            clergyman, was born in the parish of St Stephen, Norwich, and baptized
                            there on 8 December 1713. He was educated at the free school in Norwich,
                            the Charterhouse in London (1728–30), and, like his father, at Corpus
                            Christi College, Cambridge, from where he matriculated in 1730. Here he
                            graduated BA in 1734 and MA in 1737, and was a fellow from 1735 to 1738.
                            About 1734, on the recommendation of Thomas Herring, then dean of
                            Rochester, he became tutor to Philip Yorke (later second earl of
                            Hardwicke), the son of Lord Chief Justice Hardwicke. In 1737 Hardwicke
                            became lord chancellor and Salter quickly benefited from his patronage.
                            Hardwicke appointed Salter his domestic chaplain and had him preferred
                            to a prebend in Gloucester Cathedral in 1739, and to the rectory of
                            Burton Coggles, Lincolnshire, in 1740. Salter married Elizabeth Secker,
                            a relative of Thomas Secker, the future archbishop, in November 1744;
                            they left two daughters and a son, Philip, who later became vicar of
                            Shenfield in Essex. In 1751 Herring, now archbishop of Canterbury,
                            awarded Salter a Lambeth DD. Eventually Hardwicke saw that he also
                            acquired, in 1756, the rectory of St Bartholomew by the Exchange, which
                            he held jointly with his Charterhouse appointments. Salter's Norwich
                            connections also yielded fruit. In 1745 his father personally installed
                            him to a prebend in Norwich Cathedral, which he held until his death,
                            and he was for a time (1750–54) vicar of Great Yarmouth. By 1778 he was
                            also the official to the archdeacon of Norfolk. A scholar versed in the
                            classics, his publications included a contribution to Athenian Letters
                            (1741–3), principally the work of his pupil Philip Yorke, and editions
                            of Richard Bentley's Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris (1777)
                            and Benjamin Whichcot's Moral and Religious Aphorisms (1753). His
                            published sermons include one preached before the lord mayor of London
                            on 2 September 1740, the anniversary fast commemorating the great fire
                            of London. Salter began his Charterhouse years in 1754, first as
                            preacher but in effect as deputy master; and then, in 1761, he became
                            master. Here he tried to regularize inefficiencies perhaps too
                            pedantically; he soon developed acrimonious relationships with his
                            registrars and officials over bureaucratic minutiae. He died on 2 May
                            1778 at the Charterhouse, where he was buried two days later, as he
                            wished, in the common burial-ground, without slab or monument to his
                            memory. His wife survived him.</note>

                        <note>Paul Panton (1727–1797), born in Bagillt, Flintshire, to an old Welsh
                            family of noble descent, was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and
                            entered Lincoln's Inn in December 1744. Through his marriage in 1756 to
                            Jane, daughter and heir of William Jones of Plas Gwyn, Pentraeth,
                            Anglesey, he became the owner of a substantial estate and a contributor
                            to public life in Anglesey. He continued to interest himself in his
                            native Flintshire, becoming involved in particular in its increasing
                            industrialization. Like Pennant, a close friend, he travelled in
                            England, Wales and Scotland; as an antiquarian, he was interested in
                            Welsh history and literature and notably, patronized the impoverished
                            clergyman, Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd). He died on 22 May 1797. </note>

                        <note>Arabella Pennant (b.1761, d. 1828, according to ancestry.co.uk) was
                            the daughter of Thomas Pennant by his first wife, Elizabeth (née
                            Falconer). As a young woman she divided her time between Downing and the
                            home of her aunt, Catherine Pennant, at Upper Grosvenor Street in
                            London, and upon the latter's death appears to have inherited a
                            substantial sum of money. Her financial independence is signalled by her
                            contribution of £25 to the fund for setting up 'The Loyal Holywell
                            Volunteers' in March 1797, and by her decision to marry, against her
                            father's wishes, Edward, son of Sir Walden Hanmer, in November 1797. Her
                            father's will of February 1798 granted her a limited settlement, but a
                            codicil in August of the same year granted additional sums for Arabella,
                            her husband and any children (of which there were none). ODNB; John

                        <note>David Pennant (1763–1841), son of Thomas Pennant by his first wife,
                            Elizabeth (née Falconer). Following study at Christ Church, Oxford,
                            David Pennant undertook three tours of the continent, in 1785–6, 1787–8
                            and 1791–2. His father's involvement in these tours is evinced in
                            correspondence to David at Yverdon, Paris and Rome, and in the grateful
                            recognition of David's assistance in Literary Life. Travels in Britain
                            were recorded in accounts of tours to the Lake District and from London
                            to Chester in 1789 and 1792 respectively (NLW 2423B), and records of
                            travel in Yorkshire and Derbyshire, c.1792–1800, in Cheltenham and the
                            Wye in 1792, and to Burley on the Hill [Rutland] in 1800 (WCRO CR
                            2017/TP 73). David Pennant edited and published posthumously his
                            father’s A Journey from London to the Isle of Wight (1801); A Tour from
                            Downing to Alston Moor (1801); and A Tour from Alston Moor to Harrowgate
                            and Brimham Crags (1804). He also arranged the publication of four
                            volumes of Pennant's Outlines of the Globe, the third and fourth of
                            which he edited himself. David became JP for Flintshire in 1787, captain
                            of the Loyal Holywell Volunteer Corps in 1797, and High Sheriff of
                            Flintshire in 1799. On 12 December 1793 he married Louisa, second
                            daughter of Sir Henry Peyton, settling at Rose Hill on the outskirts of
                            Erbistock near Wrexham. They had one child, David [Pennant, junior]
                            (1796–1835), an obituary for whom appeared in Gentleman’s Magazine, vol.

                        <note>The genealogist Philip Yorke (1743–1804) was born at Erddig, near
                            Wrexham. His interest in things Welsh began following his second
                            marriage in 1782 to Diana, daughter of Piers Wynne of Dyffryn Aled, who
                            was descended from Marchudd, lord of Uwch Dulas. In 1795 Yorke issued
                            seventy copies of a genealogical history of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, Tracts of
                            Powys, which was dedicated to Thomas Pennant and contained letters from
                            Lewis Morris to William Vaughan and others as an appendix. A revised and
                            expanded edition of the Tracts, completed with the assistance of Walter
                            Davies (Gwallter Mechain), appeared under the title of The Royal Tribes
                            of Wales in 1799. A diffident parliamentarian, Yorke held the seats of
                            Helston (1775–1781) and Grantham (1781–1792). ODNB; History of

                        <note>Sir Ashton Lever (1729–1788), natural history collector. His
                            collection of shells, minerals, stuffed animals and artefacts evolved
                            into a museum, housed from 1773 in Leicester Square and open to visitors
                            one day a week. The enterprise was beset by financial difficulties from
                            1783 and disposed of by a lottery in March 1786. Lever died of an
                            apoplectic fit on 31 January 1788. A line engraving of him by W. Angus
                            appeared in the European Magazine in 1784, and a stipple portrait by W.
                            Nutter, after S. Shelley, was published in 1787. ODNB. </note>

                        <note>John Stuart, first marquess of Bute (1744–1814), diplomatist, was
                            known in print collecting circles from the mid-1770s, often by the title
                            'Lord Mountstuart'. This was in recognition of his place of birth, Mount
                            Stuart on the Scottish Isle of Bute, but also became his recognized
                            title when he took the post of envoy to Turin for three years from
                            August 1779. Son of John Stuart, third earl of Bute and prime minister
                            during 1762–3, the first marquess inherited the south Wales estates of
                            his wife's family of Windsor, and was created Baron Cardiff in 1776. In
                            1774, Stuart became the purchaser of Richard Bull's extra-illustrated

                        <note>Thomas Hunt (c.1723–89), of Mollington, Cheshire, was MP for Bodmin
                            from 1784 until his death at Chester on 11 October 1789. The
                            Pennant/Bull correspondence shows that he spent time at an address in
                            South Audley Street, Mayfair, and that he franked letters for Pennant.
                            His anti-Pittite stance in Parliament would seem to make him a
                            surprising friend to Bull and Pennant, but his Cornish and Cheshire
                            connections may be seen as a reason for his acquaintance with them.

                        <note>The antiquary Sir William Burrell, second baronet (1732–1796),
                            followed a legal career as advocate and was appointed chancellor of the
                            diocese of Worcester in 1764. He came to title of baronet through his
                            marriage, succeeding his father-in-law to the title in 1788. Elected FSA
                            in 1754, by 1770 he was working on the history of Sussex. Thomas
                            Pennant, A Journey from London to the Isle of Wight Volume II. From
                            Dover to the Isle of Wight (London, 1801), p. 46, mentions him as the
                            owner of ‘fine drawings’ of Herstmonceux Castle, East Sussex, which was
                            dismantled in 1777, leaving only the outer walls standing. Pennant's
                            regard for Burrell is apparent from the fact that he was one of the
                            patrons for whom he produced an edition of his Tour in Wales on large
                            paper with original Moses Griffith paintings as illustrations. ODNB s.v.

                        <note>James Granger (bap. 1723, d. 1776), vicar of Shiplake, Oxfordshire,
                            and a print collector and biographer, was renowned for his catalogue of
                            engraved historical portraits, Biographical History of England from
                            Egbert the Great to the Revolution (1769), and a supplement which
                            followed in 1774. Granger worked closely with other connoisseurs of art,
                            including Joseph Gulston, Horace Walpole and Richard Bull, with whom he
                            discussed and exchanged prints. So popular was his work that the
                            practice of ornamenting printed works with portraits and other prints
                            became firmly associated with him and his name was lent to a verb, 'to
                            grangerize', intended to describe this fashionable amateur occupation.

                            Shropshire, Rhiwgoch in Merioneth, and Llwydiarth in Montgomeryshire. He
                            shared his time between London (where he sat as MP from 1772) and
                            Wynnstay, where he had a theatre built. His 1771 expedition in north
                            Wales in the company of Paul Sandby, Thomas Apperley and others is
                            believed to have given rise to a fashion for the picturesque in
                            landscape. Sandby’s Views in North Wales (1776) was published as a
                            result of this journey. Williams Wynn died at his Westminster home on 29

                            career as a draughtsman to the military survey in Scotland gave him the
                            opportunity to work on landscape drawings. Following a move to London in
                            1752, Sandby became increasingly involved in landscape work, employing
                            various techniques (including pioneering use of aquatint), and exhibited
                            work regularly at the Society of Artists and its successor, the Royal
                            Academy. He was chief drawing master at the Royal Military Academy,
                            Woolwich, 1768–1796, and was drawing master to patrons including Sir
                            Watkin Williams Wynn. Drawings published following sketching tours in
                            Wales in 1771 and 1773 and two further series of aquatints of Welsh
                            subjects published in 1777 and 1786 helped to make Wales a popular
                            destination for touring. ODNB. </note>

                        <note>Elizabeth Bull (1749–1809) and Catherine (d. 13 October 1795) were the
                            daughters of Richard Bull and Mary, née Ash. Both shared their father’s
                            interest in print collecting and were actively involved in pasting and
                            decorating his volumes of engraved portrait heads and other

                        <note>Morris Anthony Morris Storer (1746–1799), politician and collector,
                            was the son of a wealthy West Indies merchant. He sat in Parliament as
                            member for Carlisle, Cumbria (1774–80), and for Morpeth, Northumberland
                            (1780–4), and was appointed by the Fox-North coalition as secretary of
                            the embassy at Paris on 21 September 1783. The post of
                            minister-plenipotentiary to which he was appointed on 13 December that
                            year, was held only very briefly before the fall of the coalition, and
                            Storer failed to be re-elected to parliament after 1784. He was an
                            active collector of prints and books, and an important figure in the
                            world of extra-illustration. Although his fervour for such activity was
                            dampened in the early 1780s by financial difficulties, following his
                            father's death in 1793 he inherited a substantial fortune. His
                            collections were bequeathed to Eton College Library, and included copies
                            of three extra-illustrated versions of Pennant's works: The journey from
                            Chester to London; Some Account of London (2nd ed., 1791); and A tour in
                            Wales (1784) and Journey to Snowdon (1783). He died of a ‘deep decline’
                            after years of poor health. ODNB; History of Parliament on-line; Peltz,

                        <note>John Lloyd (1733–1793), son of John Lloyd (d. 1756), Bodidris, became
                            curate at Caerwys, Flintshire in 1761 and was appointed rector there in
                            1778. Thomas Pennant in the 'Advertisement' to A tour in Wales.
                            MDCCLXXVIII described him as 'my constant companion in these
                            excursions'. Pennant relied heavily on Lloyd for translations of Welsh
                            manuscript material, for his extensive knowledge of Welsh history, and
                            for commentary on and correction of the early drafts of the Welsh tours.
                            He was known to others, too, for his erudition: Iolo Morganwg visited
                            him in 1772, Evan Evans in 1786, and he corresponded with Philip Yorke
                            of Erddig, who shared his interest in genealogy. When he died on 22 May
                            1793, Pennant organized a fund to aid his widow Martha (d.1810),
                            daughter of Francis Williams, with whom he had ten children. A 1780
                            portrait of Lloyd by Moses Griffith, engraved by Peter Mazell, appears

                        <note>Born in Florence, the engraver Francesco Bartolozzi (1728–1815) was
                            considered as the best engraver in Italy by the 1760s. Having had some
                            of his work published in London in 1763, he was invited there by the art
                            dealer Richard Dalton in 1764 and spent the next 35 years working there.
                            He exhibited with the Society of Artists and thereafter at the Royal
                            Academy, and established a vogue for dotted prints or 'stipples'. Most
                            of his work was commanded by printsellers and he had others working for
                            him including Luigi Schiavonetti and John Keyes Sherwin. In 1801 he
                            moved to Lisbon to reform the royal printing press but died at his

                        <note>Levinia Luther (née Bennett) (d. c.1807) was the daughter of Bennett
                            Alexander Bennett and Mary (née Ash), of Ongar, Essex, but was raised
                            from a young age by her mother's second husband, Richard Bull. She
                            married John Luther (?1739–86), of Myles’s, near Ongar, in 1762,
                            returning to her mother and step-father's home following the failure of
                            the marriage in early 1764. She inherited the estate of Sir Humphry
                            Morice (?1723–85), MP for Launceston and a close family friend, valued
                            by a contemporary at £200,000, and appears to have lived at Morice's
                            home, the Grove, Middlesex. It is likely that she was involved alongside

                            probably of German origin, but had adopted the surname Albin by 1708, by
                            which time he lived in Piccadilly. His three-volume publication, A
                            Natural History of Birds (1731–8) involved the study of exotic birds
                            owned by Thomas Lowther, duke of Chandos, and by the silk weaver and
                            naturalist Joseph Dandridge, as well as of birds acquired at Newgate
                            market and from sea captains and foreign merchants. It includes 306
                            plates, some of which may have been painted by Albin's daughter,
                            Elizabeth (b. 1708). ODNB.</note>

                        <note>James Basire (bap. 1730, d. 1802) was the eldest son of a printmaker
                            and draughtsman whose publishing company he took over. His training
                            included a period spent in Italy from 1749, alongside the artist,
                            engraver, and antiquarian Richard Dalton. Back in London from late 1752,
                            he began on a successful career as an etcher and engraver, one of the
                            highlights of which was his appointment in succession to George Vertue
                            as engraver to the Society of Antiquaries in 1759. This post led to
                            constant employment, including work on plates for Charles Cordiner's
                            Antiquities and Scenery of the North of Scotland (1780), and pioneering
                            work on an engraving of the sixteenth-century painting known as The
                            Field of the Cloth of Gold. In 1770 Basire was appointed engraver to the
                            Royal Society. ODNB.</note>

                            in 1770, and travelled to Rome in 1774, returning to England by 1776. He
                            exhibited at the Royal Academy in the late 1770s and again in the
                            mid-1780, probably spending the years between 1779 and 1784 visiting
                            Gibraltar and St Petersburg. An exhibition in Pall Mall, London, in
                            1785, showed his enterprise insomuch as it claimed that its contents had
                            been 'painted without commission' and was on offer to 'any nobleman or
                            gentleman who may wish to possess either the whole or a part of them'.
                            It was not a success, but engravings after the pictures were received
                            more positively. He sailed for India in December 1785, and auctioned
                            some of his pictures there between November 1786 and January 1787. ODNB
                            says that he left India 'about a year later'. ODNB. </note>

                            medicine for life as a political writer. He met Pennant at Downing
                            during a tour of Britain in 1787, an account of which he wrote in a
                            series of unpublished letters. His wide-ranging interests in several
                            branches of literature led to the establishment of the Analytical
                            Review, a review of books to which he contributed many of the articles
                            in the initial volumes. Six months spent in Paris in early 1790 ensured
                            his firm support of the Revolution and, in 1792, he returned to work on
                            the English part of the new French constitution. ODNB; Nichols, Literary

                            daughter of William Skrine and his first wife Jane Sumner, although it
                            is not certain that Skrine was in fact her real father. In 1777 she
                            married Sir Thomas Clarges, 3rd baronet (1751–82/3). After his death she
                            made frequent visits to Italy, before settling in England in 1799. The
                            children of the marriage included Thomas, who succeeded to his father's
                            title on coming of age 25 December 1802; Louisa (d. 1806, aged 27); and
                            William (1782–1807), but the Bull-Pennant correspondence suggests that
                            there was another son, killed in naval service in 1794 (see TP189/53).
                            Portraits of Lady Clarges were painted by Thomas Gainsborough and John
                            Downman. On her relationship with Richard Bull's daughters, see

                        <note>Richard Clarke of Newport, Isle of Wight, died in 1817, aged 80. He
                            subscribed to books of sermons published in 1757 and 1786 and was
                            included in a list of the governors and officers of the 'Asylum for the

                            Lincolnshire Archives (1 WORSLEY 10A). He corresponded directly with
                            Pennant in 1793, and also answered his queries on the Isle of Wight at

                            of commander-in-chief during the American War of Independence. He
                            returned to England in June 1782, where he found himself widely held
                            responsible for the British defeat. Through the offices of influential
                            friends from the time of the American war he was thereafter found a seat
                            in parliament, where he had already served between 1774 and 1784, this
                            time to represent Launceston (1790–4). Friends also secured him the post

                            before leaving Britain. He had three sons and two daughters from his

                            at the Shrewsbury Assizes in August 1784, where he managed to arrest
                            judgement in the case on the grounds that the indictment was defective.

                            and lawyer for the defence in the treason trials of 1794, where he
                            argued that the London Corresponding Society sought parliamentary reform

                            (1774–80), and was sheriff of Denbighshire in 1781–2. In 1776 he
                            purchased Llewenny, where he established a bleaching factory. His new
                            calling as a linen merchant was an attempt to save himself from
                            financial difficulties brought on by unprofitable estates in Ireland. A
                            contemporary, Richard Twining, wrote that ‘The buildings which he has
                            erected, and the machines and apparatus which he has placed in them are
                            really astonishing’, and mentioned the shop which Fitzmaurice opened in
                            Chester to sell the bleached linen. In 1777 he married Lady Mary
                            O'Brien, daughter of Murrough, 5th Earl of Inchiquin [I], by Mary, s.j.
                            Countess of Orkney. She inherited her mother's title and her estate of

                            A halfhearted politician, he twice held the parliamentary seat for Poole
                            (1765–8 and 1780–4), but his main passion was book- and
                            print-collecting, which he was enabled to do on inheriting a fortune of
                            £250,000 in funds following the death of his father in 1766. Together
                            with his wife, Elizabeth (née Stepney), an artist and etcher, he built a
                            collection of books and prints, including 23,500 British and 18,000
                            foreign portraits, earning a reputation for rapaciousness. His
                            extravagance gradually led to financial ruin, which he attempted to
                            counteract by the sale in 1775 of his home, Ealing Grove in Middlesex
                            (lavishly transformed into an Italianate villa following his marriage),
                            and of his book and print collections (in 1783/4 and early 1786
                            respectively). He died on 16 July 1786. ODNB; History of Parliament

                            in 1785 but was impeached on 10 May 1787 largely due to the efforts of
                            Edmund Burke, who held him responsible for the rapacious policies of the
                            East India Company in its provinces, its exploitation of its allies, and
                            its wars. The prosecution closed its case on 30 May 1791 but further
                            prosecution speeches were delivered in 1794 before a large majority of
                            the Lords voted ‘not guilty’ the following year. ODNB.</note>

                            Russia, Chief Secretary in Ireland, Governor of Madras, an embassy to
                            Peking, a mission to Verona to the exiled Louis the 18th, and the post
                            of governor of the Cape. The embassy to China was undertaken for the
                            joint purposes of the East India Company and the government, who wished
                            to improve conditions for trade with China. A party of 94, including
                            many experts, sailed on the Lion on 26 September 1792 with samples of
                            the best of British manufactures, which were presented to the Emperor of
                            China on 14 September 1793. Macartney was unable to ensure a treaty of
                            trade and friendship and was handed his dismissal on 3 October 1793.
                            Nonetheless he was raised to an earldom in the Irish peerage in 1794
                            following his return, via the southern Chinese province of Canton.

                        <note>John Palmer (1742–1818), theatre proprietor and postal reformer.
                            Theatre work between London and Bristol convinced Palmer of the need for
                            improved communications, involving the replacement of the post boy with
                            a small cart by mail coaches equipped with a box watched over by an
                            armed guard and able to ensure the prompt dispatch of mail. The coaches
                            were exempt from tolls and granted priority over other vehicles so that
                            the momentum of their journeys was sustained. There were differences
                            with the post office, but Palmer shouldered the cost of the reform, in
                            which Pitt had shown an interest. In August 1786, the post office
                            appointed him on suitable terms but his position was not confirmed until
                            July 1789. Pennant was infuriated by the issue of the mail coaches, and
                            expressed his views in A letter to a Member of Parliament, on
                            Mail-Coaches (London: R. Faulder, 1792). ODNB. </note>

                            inherited substantial plantations in Jamaica, and Richard added to the
                            family wealth the Penrhyn estate in Caernarvonshire, through his
                            marriage to Anne Susannah Warburton (1745–1816) in 1765. A member of
                            parliament for Liverpool (1767–1780; 1784–1790), he opposed William
                            Wilberforce’s campaign for the abolition of slavery in 1787, and the
                            following year spoke in the House of Commons in defence of slave traders
                            and planters. In 1782 the medieval Penrhyn Hall was remodelled by Samuel

                            son of a shipyard labourer. His talent for drawing was discovered by
                            William Mitford, on whose estate near Petworth, Sussex, Sherwin worked
                            as a gardener in 1769. This led to study in London, where he was taught
                            to engrave by Francis Bartolozzi, with whom he stayed until 1774.
                            Contemporaries mention his ‘vanity’ and ‘impudent assurance’. He died in

                            Strawberry Hill, Middlesex, author, politician and patron of the arts.
                            He was son of the Whig politician and prime minister Sir Robert Walpole,
                            first earl of Orford, and held parliamentary seats between 1741 and
                            1768. From 1746 he made his home in a small house at Windsor, which he
                            transformed into a 'little Gothic castle', under the name of Strawberry
                            Hill, adding new rooms, including a library, in 1754. His interest in
                            portraiture was sparked by his acquaintance, from 1743, with George
                            Vertue, and led to the publication of Anecdotes of Painting in England
                            (2 vols., 1762; vol. 3 1764), a work which he highly prized among his
                            oeuvre. ODNB; History of Parliament on-line. </note>

                            of the Isle of Wight (1781), begun by his father and grandfather. He sat

                            1801, resigning in 1784 to travel to the continent, to return in 1788.
                            Whilst abroad, he acquired a collection of statues, reliefs and gems,

                            account of this journey, A Gentleman’s Tour through Monmouthshire, and
                            Wales, the following year. He revisited Wales in 1777, accompanied by
                            the Swiss watercolour painter Samuel Hieronymous Grimm, and in 1781
                            published Tour through Monmouthshire and Wales. He was elected a fellow
                            of the Society Antiquaries in 1777 and of the Royal Society 1783, and
                            was member of Parliament for Wiltshire, 1795–1812. </note>
