                <p>I am sorry that I must again plead my being obliged <gap reason="illegible" unit="word" quantity="2"/> from home for a fortnight past <gap reason="illegible" unit="word" atLeast="2" atMost="3"/> for not writing you
                    sooner –––––</p>
                <p>I send you inclosed some remarks upon <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0651">I-colm-kill</placeName>
                    I found it necessary to be <add place="above">more</add> particular in them
                    thany you would deem requisite, as by the last visit to that island I had an
                    opportunity of being informed of some more circumstances &amp; facts, and of
                    examining by measurement lengths and distances which before were but imperfectly
                    guessed at by the eye —</p>
                <p>Except <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0977">the monastery of Monks</placeName> and <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0975">that of the nuns</placeName>, I hardly think that any of the other
                    buildings merit a particular or minute description from you –––––</p>
                <p>I shall endeavour to send you by next week's post the Remarks upon <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0653">

                    opportunity in my power of sending you the rest in due time –––––</p>
                <p>I am not a little concerned that I should in any measure be the means of stopping
                    or retarding your progress in your work — Surely no new intelligence that I can
                    impart to you relative to your voyage can be of such consequence as that it
                    ought to have that effect.</p>
