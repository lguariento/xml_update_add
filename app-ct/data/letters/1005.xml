                        Great Ealing, Middlesex in April 1778, and from Pennant to his son, David at

                        and /429. It seems likely that David Pennant was a pupil at Great Ealing
                        school. Note also that Ealing Grove in Middlesex was the home of the book
                        and art collector Joseph Gulston, transformed into an Italianate villa
                        following his marriage in 1767. ODNB s.v. Joseph Gulston.</note> last
