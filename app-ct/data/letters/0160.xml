                            is with pleasure we observe the long looked for publication of Mr
                            Pennant's last Tour in Scotland, and his Voyage to the Hebrides; and
                            with gratitude we must acknowledge, that, by a minute investigation of
                            its antiquities, particularly in the remote Islands,illustrated by many
                            elegant engravings, he has thrown more light on the antient and natural
                            history of this country than any preceding writer has hitherto done. â€”
                            As the book must as yet be but in few hands, we have selected from this
                            valuable work the following Soliloquy, or Dream, at the conclusion of
                            the volume, which merits the attention of every patriotic
