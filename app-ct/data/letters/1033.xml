                    <note type="editorial">The dating of this letter presents some problems. Pennant mentions large paper copies of The journey from Chester to London in no.17 (29 January 1782); discusses the expense of extra-illustrating it, and promises to 'take care of the drawings of arms for the 1st vol Tour in Wales' in no. 18 (14 April 1782); orders large paper prints for The journey from Chester to London in no. 20 (26 May 1782); and says he has a large paper copy of it for Bull in no. 28 (6 July 1783). Bull says that he has shown his extra-illustrated copy of The journey from Chester to London to a 'dozen Amateurs' as a sample of Moses Griffith's work in TP 189 /2 (21 February 1786). This seems to point to around 1782 or 1783.</note>

                <p>We hear the distant roll of political thunder: without any great hopes of being bettered: &amp; we are happily in too low a situation to be hurt by it. I dread the bolt which may fall on our northern coast; &amp; which I fear can scarcely be prevented as we are so out-fleeted.
