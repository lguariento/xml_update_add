                <p>Last Week your agreeable Favours of 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Current came
                    to hand, which ought to have been immediately acknowledged, had not Business
                    prevented.</p>
                <p>Not chusing to destroy any of your Letters, I presume to return inclosed that for

                    having been served with a return some time ago from <persName ref="pe0104">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gough</persName>, corresponding with a Note I
                    accidentaly met with amongst some of my loose Papers: I am now certain that

                    returned to him several years ago &amp; have accordingly refresht his Memory by
                    Letter on that subject: probably the distress with Rheumatisms &amp;<hi rend="superscript">c.</hi> that he has been so long tormented with may have
                        short<add place="above">en</add>ed his Memory &amp;<hi rend="superscript">c.</hi> being fully persuaded, this must be by him or in the Hands of some
                    of his Friends in <placeName ref="pl0701">Orkney</placeName> as it was soon after it's
                    arrival from <placeName ref="pl0699">London</placeName> transmitted by me to him, with
                    this remark to <hi rend="underline">attentively read it over again &amp; correct

                    him several weeks ago but have had no Answer, nor heard from him since he wrote
                    me the beginning of the Year, when he was <sic>in very pityable Situation</sic>,
                    since from the late agreable weather we have been favour'd with, he has got
                    considerably relieved, of this I am assured by friends who saw him not long
                    since.</p>
                <p>His silence deserves Censure, especialy to you, but I can &amp; do forgive him,
                    having no Inclination to differ with any Person, unless I be maltreated, — then
                    I've no further connection, when all correspondence is at an End. ––––– But from

                    reasonable request (as you modestly suggest to me) will be granted: this I'm
                    under necessity to see performed to both your mutual satisfactions, since the
                    first Correspondence <add place="above">commenced</add>.</p>
