                    it's basis is still visible the <sic>remain</sic> of an old stone-dyke or fence

                    one place another dyke appears to have run up the hills perpendicular to it; and
                    in one of the angles there is still a small pit or cavity. The tradition of the
                    inhabitants is that in the days of Ossian, when men lived by the chace, the
                    whole island was much under wood and abounded in deer; that the design of this,
                    as well as of similar fences still retaining the same name in other parts of
                        <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0715">Sky</placeName> was to facilitate the
                    destruction of these animals; that the pit in the corner was at first deep and
                        <gap reason="damage" unit="word" quantity="1"/>
                    <gap reason="damage" quantity="1" unit="character"/>overed with branches of
                    trees, so that when they were forced towards it by dogs from all the more
                    distant parts of the hill, they unwarily fell into it, and found it out of their
                    power to recover themselves. — If you remember we saw in some of the moors of
                        <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0717">
                        <hi rend="underline">Ilay</hi>
                    </placeName>
                    vestiges of inclosures of the same kind. The opinion there with regard to them
                    seems to be that they were intended for defending the heather from cattle in
                    these early days in which beer is said to have been made of it's tops by the
                    ancient Caledonians.</p>

                    was any considerable difference have likewise written them at the foot of the
