                <p>I cannot sufficiently admire your communicative disposition, in so kindly sending
                        <rs type="art" ref="ardb.xml#ar0045">the sketch of the curious fish</rs>
                    taken on y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> coast. Instead of receiving yr apology
                    for troubling me as you are pleased to style, accept my best thanks for the
                    favor done me, &amp; let me beg the continuance.</p>

                <p>I am not clear that y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> fish is described: but must
                    inform you it is of the genus which <bibl type="authorial">
                        <title ref="bidb.xml#bi0418">Linnaeus</title>
                    </bibl> calls Esox &amp;
                    approaches the species of Garfish or sea needle; but differs from it in having
                    several spurious fins between the dorsal &amp; ventral fins &amp; the tail. I do
                    presume that y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> drawing is exact as to the mandibles
                    of the jaws being of equal length; for in case the lower mandible was broken,
                    &amp; had been originally much longer than the upper, in that case it will prove
                    the same with a new fish <persName ref="pe0008">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Banks</persName> favored me with from <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0694">Newfoundland</placeName>. Be so good as to inform me
                    of the above particular.</p>
                <p>In respect to my American Zoology, it is my design to divide it into two works
                    one to take in the animals of <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0697">north
                        America</placeName> the other of <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0698">south</placeName>: they will differ widely in their productions &amp; are
                    besides <sic>to</sic> numerous to be treated of in one volume.<note type="editorial">In the advertisement to his 1784 <bibl type="editorial">

                        </bibl>, Pennant explains that he abandoned his
                        plans for an American Zoology after American independence, and instead
                        worked the materials he had acquired into the current volume.</note> The
                    size will be octavo to be illustrated with plates of the new or rare kinds. Any
                    communications of that kind will be acceptable; &amp; any whatever subjects I am
                    favored with shall be safely restored. I shall be glad to hear that y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                    <persName ref="pe0299">friend</persName> gives you the history of each
                    bird; for without that base descriptions make but dull work. You put an &amp;c
                    to y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> collection from <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0693">Jamaica</placeName>, pray does it comprehend any of
                    the lesser beasts, especially the cane rat which I wish to see.</p>
