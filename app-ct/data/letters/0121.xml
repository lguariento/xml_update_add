                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Your two very kind favors are before me: I never shall be unmindful of your
                    steady friendship, for you are the same whether I am north or south of the
                        <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0727">Tweed</placeName>; <sic>a reproach your
                        countrymen are too liable to that of verifying the Proverb out of sight out
                        of mind.</sic>
                </p>
                <p>I am much obliged to you for the trouble you had about the boxes: of the two
                    entered the day you mention I had but one; the little one with lead over being
                    missing. It is true another of snuff was sent sometime after by <persName ref="pe0157">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Macgovan</persName>,
                    but that arrived safely. in a word I am resolved to recover my box or sue
                        <persName ref="pe0027">the carrier</persName> I mean him of
                        <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0076">Edinburgh</placeName> who by admitting the
                    Entry in his books is liable to the charge.</p>
                <p>I am well assured that the publication of <bibl type="authorial">
                        <title ref="bidb.xml#bi0050">the whales</title>
                    </bibl> will answer. if you
                    undertake it on your own account solely, I shall beg y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> acceptance of <rs type="art" ref="ar0047">the 4 plates</rs> I would offer so till you resolve me, I
                    shall defer sending <rs type="art" ref="ar0103">the sketches</rs>. I would propose putting the Whole copy into
                    the hands of <persName ref="pe0026">my own Bookseller</persName> to be sold for
                    you. I presume the printing &amp; paper will not cost you 12<hi rend="superscript">L</hi> . Pray send me proofs of each of the old
                    prints.</p>
                <p>I am much obliged to you for the list of Sir R. Sibbalds works: Pray can you find
                    anything new in <bibl type="authorial">
