                    the news writer; I hope.<note type="editorial">This may refer to the
                        discussions carried out during informal talks in Paris in April 1782, which
                        led to official negotiations for peace in July 1782 and to the signing of
                        definitive articles of peace on 3 September 1783. Robert Middlekauff, The
                        Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789 (revised and expanded

                        259–64.</note> But the strangest account is the return of <persName ref="pe0347">Lord North</persName> into ministry.<note type="editorial">Lord North resigned as prime minister on 20 March 1782. He
                        did not return into office until February 1783, when a coalition between his
                        party and that of Charles James Fox brought down the ministry of Lord
                        Shelburne, but the formation of this coalition was considered likely from
                        July 1782. ODNB s.n. Fredrick North, second earl of Guilford [known as Lord

                    abilities! I cannot but feel some anxiety till <placeName ref="pldb.xml#pl0775">old England</placeName> is secure: I <sic>hap^ly</sic> have amusements that
