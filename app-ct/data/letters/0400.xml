                            to David Skene. The copies are likely the work of Alexander Thomson, who
                            on his death in 1868, bequeathed the collection to Aberdeen University
                            Library. See Colin A. McLaren, ‘Reports and surveys of archives in

                <p>I give you many thanks for your kind favor and for your agreable intelligence: be
                    assured that I have not forgot my promise; I should be ashamed to be unmindful
                    of your favors so far as to neglect you without some shew of reason. I have
                    begun the list of the ores &amp;c. I mean to send. I only waited till the
                    gentleman who is to paint your birds; has restored them to me that I may not be
                    worse than my word but return them safely to you. My next letter will bring you
                    the catalogue; and advice that the box is set off: You must wait with a little
                    patience, as I am to set off to morrow on a Tour through <placeName ref="pl1183">the Welsh Alps</placeName> a country I am sorry to say far inferior in
                    point of grandeur to <placeName ref="pl0711">the Highlands</placeName>.</p>
