    <description>This four-year AHRC-funded research project,
    launched in September 2014 and jointly run by the University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies
    (CAWCS) and the University of Glasgow, will explore Romantic-period accounts of journeys into Wales and Scotland.
    Our focus is on the writings of the Flintshire naturalist and antiquarian Thomas Pennant (1726-1798),
    whose published Tours of both countries did so much to awaken public interest in the ‘peripheries’ of Britain.
    We aim to open a window onto the vivid and often entertaining accounts of scores of ‘curious travellers’
    who headed for the edges of the British Isles in search of the primitive, the picturesque and the sublime–and
    often found the foreign, and the unsettling, surprisingly close to home.</description>
